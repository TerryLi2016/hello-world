# hello-world
It's an interesting try to get start program with github!
Why am I here? I think it's just because I want to learn program again.
Since I am a product manager, I have to know some basic program knowledge so that I can better communicate with my co-work programers.
I am so much into GitHub because it's such an simple and elegent masterpiece.
